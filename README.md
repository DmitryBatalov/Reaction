# Re:action

Re:action is a lightweight Async Reactive (Rx) Elmish-ish library for F# targetting [Fable](http://fable.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Currently a playground project for experimenting with MVU-based web applications using async reactive functional programming (Async Observables) in F#. The project is heavily inspired by [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/) but currently a separate project since it does not have any dependencies to any of these projects. The inspiration for Async Observables and plain old functions (POF) comes from [aioreactive](https://github.com/dbrattli/aioreactive)

Re:action uses simple functions instead of classes and the traditional Rx interfaces. Some of the operators uses mailbox processors (actors) to implement the observer pipeline in order to avoid locks and mutables. This makes the code much more Fable friendly so the code can be easily transpiled to JavaScript.

```f#
type Notification<'a> =
    | OnNext of 'a
    | OnError of exn
    | OnCompleted

type AsyncDisposable = unit -> Async<unit>
type AsyncObserver<'a> = Notification<'a> -> Async<unit>
type AsyncObservable<'a> = AsyncObserver<'a> -> Async<AsyncDisposable>

type AsyncMapper<'a, 'b> = 'a -> Async<'b>
type AsyncPredicate<'a> = 'a -> Async<bool>
type AsyncAccumulator<'s, 't> = 's -> 't -> Async<'s>
```

MVU example using Re:action for impl. the classic Time Flies example from RxJS.
No jQuery in this example. This code is very simplar to Elmish but the difference
is that we have the power to compose powerful reactive queries to transform, filter,
aggregate and time-shift our stream of messages.

```f#
// Messages for updating the model
type Msg =
    | MouseEvent of MouseEvent
    | LetterMove of int * char * float * float

// Model (state) for updating the view
let update (currentModel : Model) (msg : Msg) =
    match currentModel.Pos, msg with
    | _, LetterMove (i, c, x, y) ->
        { currentModel with Pos = currentModel.Pos.Add (i, (c, x, y)) }
    | _ ->
        currentModel

// View for being observed by React
let view (model : Model) =
    async {
        return div []
            [ printLetters model.Pos ]
    }

let main = async {
    let initialModel = { Pos = Map.empty }

    let moves = from <| Seq.toList "TIME FLIES LIKE AN ARROW"
                |> flatMapIndexed (fun x i ->
                        fromMouseMoves ()
                        |> delay (100.0 * float i)
                        |> map (fun m -> LetterMove (i, x, m.clientX + float i * 10.0 + 15.0, m.clientY))
                   )
                |> scan initialModel update
                |> mapAsync view

    let render n =
        async {
            match n with
            | OnNext dom -> renderReact "elmish-app" dom
            | _ -> ()
        }

    do! moves render |> Async.Ignore
}

main |> Async.StartImmediate
