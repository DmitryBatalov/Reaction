# Introduction

Reaction is an F# implementation of Async Observables ([ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/)) and was designed spesifically for targeting [Fable](http://fable.io/) which means that the code may be [transpiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) to JavaScript, and thus the same F# code may be used both client and server side for full stack software development.

See [Fable Reaction](https://github.com/dbrattli/Fable.Reaction) for Elmish-ish use of Reaction.
